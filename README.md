# Csci191T-01-lessons
Game dev lessons for the group to use

Dhanyu's website for files and external lessons: https://www.dhanyu.com/csci191/

Before running the lessons it is important to note: 
- These lessons are all based around Windows so no other OS will work
- (You only have to do this once!) Glut32.dll goes into the 'C:\Windows' folder to 
  replace the one currently there so that the lessons will be able to properly run 
  in the CodeBlocks editor.
